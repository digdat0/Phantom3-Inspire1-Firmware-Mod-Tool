# Phantom 3 and Inspure 1 Mod Tool
A batch file which makes the Phantom 3 and Inspire 1 modding process more user friendly.

You select your aircraft, then your version. If that firmware isn't already downloaded, it downloads it. After download it opens a menu of options. It can extract the firmware, extract the flight controller module, allow you to edit the parameters (hoping to add patching one day), re-compile the flight controller module with updated parameters, rename the flight controller module to a service file to allow install, clean-up the files and also create a debug file.

The steps are supposed to be run in sequence 1-4

Supported aircraft:

 - Phantom 3 Professional
 - Phantom 3 Advanced
 - Phantom 3 Standard
 - Phantom 3 4k
 - Phantom 3 Se
 - Inspire 1 v1
 - Inspire 1 Pro FC350
 - Inspire 1 Pro FC550
 - Inspire 1 Pro RAW 

To use .. download the two files, put in same folder. Run the batch file. You need Java and Python installed.
